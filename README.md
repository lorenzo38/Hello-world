# Hello-world
I have always been fascinated by web or internet technologies. I was held back for so long until I finally made up my mind to begin my journey. Its intimidating though but I am not going to back down. my grasp of html is satisfactory. I am currently learning CSS.

If I fail it is because I quit.
